		Hey all! (or none?)
		<br><br>
		I decided to make this site, since I've been meaning to for a while, and I have a lot of time on my hands now.
		<br><br>
		I'm going to try to update it fairly regularly, I'll put a lot of my art on it, some programming projects, maybe some music<c style="color:#7f7f7f;">?</c>
		<br><br>
		For now, lots of the links aren't going to work, and a lot of content will be missing since I'm still slowly figuring out how I want it to be made.
